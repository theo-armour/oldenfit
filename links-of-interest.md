* [Aerobic Fitness May Trump Strength for Metabolic Health](
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/04/well/move/aerobic-fitness-may-trump-strength-for-metabolic-health.html )
	> Endurance affects metabolism substantially more than muscular strength does, a new study suggests.

	> **Findings**  In this cross-sectional study of 580 young Finnish men, after adjusting for covariates, aerobic fitness accounted for more than an additional 5% of the variation of 25 serum metabolome measures that are associated with a reduction in cardiometabolic risk. There were fewer beneficial associations of maximal muscular strength with the studied metabolic risk factors.

	> **Meaning**  Aerobic fitness was associated with beneficial levels of metabolites associated with reduced vascular and metabolic disease risk.

Thoughts

* Time: Should allow four hours for each 1 1/2 hour class if driving. 6+ hours if public transport
* Transport costs: $40-$50 each way using Lyft. $60 using gigcarshare.com
* Thoughts: time is a big issue. Cost is an issue
* Should go and have a look
