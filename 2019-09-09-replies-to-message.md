> Thank you sharing your thoughts with me; they help me understand you a
little better so I can be a better support/resource for you. I think you
are mostly on track.

And thank you for your speedy and engaged reply.


> 1) You wrote, "Many of my interactions with people result in binge drinking" and so will you tell me if you think going out in the community for exercise will contribute to your binge drinking?

I did not mention in my previous notes that I am very much of a night owl. When I stop working, one of my favorite thing is going to a pub and talking to strangers about their lives. This helps me to learn and feel about what is out of my bubble and more. This often includes buying drinks for my new friends and and they returning the compliment and so on.

I could go out before working but my morning brain is the best for three to four hours full concentration so I try to set up appointments for later in the day.

And so, if and when I go out, then by the time I get back it is evening and I will probably walk by one of a dozen or so places where they know my name. And, well, stuff happens.

In any case, I am slowly cutting down consumption from 20 to 30 drinks per week - say 2 to 3 a day - down to 10 to 20 drinks a week with 2 or 3 days with no alcohol.



> 2) You are bright and creative, but also expressed "Finding people to discuss face-to-face the technical aspects of what I do is near impossible." Have you thought about teaching an online college class to grow the numbers of people doing what you do?

Yes, I have thought about creating a course for udemy.com, but I never found a partner to work with. In any case, much of my online work is showing people how to do things. I often build demos and then people embed the code in their organizations online workflow. So online, I have friends from every continent except Antarctica - and can happily discuss whatever whenever. The issue is trying to replicate the depth of the interactions in the meatworld. My chitchat in the pub is very much a about letting people talk about themselves and their feelings. The opportunities for coming across somebody who can discuss linear algebra or manipulating hundreds of megabytes of data in near real-time or building an opera or film set that incorporates augmented reality are rare. The kind of technologies that I play with are very much niche items and few peeps of my generation have ever had let alone still have such skill sets.

Having said all that, the main thing is that I understand a good amount of the situation I have created and on the whole I am pleased the current outcome.

On the other hand, not that I have one, I do also understand that there is more that I can and should be doing to be old and fit. And I look this as being one of my favorite things: learning new ways of doing things and sharing the lessons learned as I do so.

And I hope you will guide me on this journey.
