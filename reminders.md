# Reminders


## Things I remember hearing

* It's good to build a "reserve"
* Weight training would be good
* Build endurance would be good
* Get a coach
* Do it now
* Get out of the house
* See specialists
* Access professional equipment
* Call Paul Sacamono
* Term at College of San Mateo has started
* Step platform is too high
	* I reduced height and - wow - what a nice difference!

_What did I miss?_


### Establish some objectives

* Identify and share useful books, articles, papers and sites ( & podcasts )
* Identify useful metrics
* Find activities that normal people can do in their daily lives
	* Wherever they are
	* Whatever their income
	* In environmentally responsible manner
* Document what happens


### Remember we are in no hurry

* Build healthy habits and reducing harmful habits takes time
* Knowing that changing one habit for the better may have harmful effects on other habits
* Slow and steady wins the race


### Remember my history of adapting

* Recovery from accident
* Attempt at swimming English Channel
* Stopping smoking
* Losing 25 kg at about 2 kg per year
* Altering diet to Mediterranean
* Reducing alcohol consumption (WIP)
* Exercising continuously rather than several times a week

### Remember to balance the priorities

* The past three years have been some of the best, most fun in my life
* I am very lucky to be living with such little pain. Fingers crossed this continues
* My use of computers has many aspects associated with addictive behaviors
* Finding people to discuss face-to-face the technical aspects of what I do is near impossible
* Many of my interactions with people results in binge drinking
* I have too many projects and things I am working on
* In terms of [Maslow's Hierachy of Needs]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs ), my pyramid is quite full
* I love and am loved
