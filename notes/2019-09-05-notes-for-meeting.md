_Started but never completed, but text may be useful as material for future notes._

## Fitness objectives

* Not trying to break records or even improve, just want to stay reasonably fit
* Establish routines that work for me in my home
* Could work for next, say, five years

## Strategies

* A qualified person to talk to on a regular basis

## History wanted?

* Contacts with Dr Erica Pitsch / UCSF?
* Medical history
* Bio

## Communications

* Email OK?

## Current getting up routines

* 10 hip-ups
* 5 leg raises
* 10 head look up / look down
* 10 look left look right
* 10 squats
* Wiggle while brushing teeth
* Do the dishes while dancing
* 1 to 3 minute dedicated dancing

## During the day

* Try for 5,000 steps
	* 8,000 is really nice
	* Below 3,000 sucks
* Scheduled - but many misses
	* Every 18 minutes get up from desk for a minute or two
	* Every 3 minutes do a little move at desk
